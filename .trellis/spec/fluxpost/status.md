# FluxPost Current Status

Last updated: 2026-10-28

## One-Line Status

Local LAN 3001 uses OSS on 10d1ebf; 71,788 media keys aligned. Final backup, reference transaction and authenticated acceptance passed.

## Current Focus

- Wonder Image ingress/JSON/media/error repair passed offline/browser checks; LAN remains OSS candidate `10d1ebf` because queues are not idle. Real Yike/model acceptance is pending.
- Generated library retired: 22,255 index assets and three tables removed without a cleanup backup. Ordinary assets remain: 2,301; nonempty collections: 24; memberships: 2,230; labels: 5,302.
- Qwen `0b775c7` included in authorized LAN release; Gemini live testing paused.

## Next Entry

OSS evidence: `.trellis/tasks/archive/2026-10/10-28-oss-acceptance-local-cutover/verification.md`. Local cutover complete; retain TOS >= Nov 4. Production and historical-link cleanup require separate scope. No generated-table recreation.

## Risks And Unknowns

- Wonder user run returned HTTP 400/no JobId; historical action/cause is unconfirmed. Repair has no live Yike acceptance or paid replay; activate after queue/operator preflight. See wonder-image-repair task.
- Context budget fixed by archive; baseline domain checks pass then stop at 17 existing ignored-script lint errors. Separate lint/type/build/smoke passed; no gate weakened.
- Text reasoning effort must be supported by the configured model and provider; unsupported values surface the upstream error without stripping or retrying the parameter.
- Gemini live text/image acceptance remains pending. Minimal diagnostics were authorized, then explicitly paused; do not send further calls until resumed.
- ToAPIs ordinary ratio/tier versus VIP/Official pixels live acceptance is unconfirmed. Concurrent Vision failures previously returned upstream 502 HTML; explicit retry is required by the one-attempt queue.
- Real 621-asset runtime migration and authenticated gallery/multi-user review remain operator gates; isolated fixture migration passed. PostgreSQL subtree benchmark P95 is 252.6ms against 300ms.
- No paid Qwen/publishing acceptance. Local OSS verified: 2,301 assets, 1,637 copy entries preserved. Historical missing URLs and nine TOS-pending files retained. Production unchanged. Qwen key backup is operator-managed.
- Stationary Mac Chrome Canvas flicker cause remains unconfirmed; Windows evidence points to edge animations/compositing as a candidate only.
- Never roll back to generated-table-dependent `72dca31`. Recovery code: `4791dcc`; final identity is in the ignored activation receipt.
- Historical per-ID and cloud-original completeness remain unproven; current inventory is backed up.
